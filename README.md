# Digital Elevation Model Tools

This is the **Python** implementation of **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** tools.

### Terms and Abbrevations:

| Term                         | Abbrevation | Remark 
| ---------------------------- | :---------: | :----: 
| Digital Elevation Model      | DEM         | 
| Geographic Coordinate System | GCS         | 3D 
| Projected Coordinate System  | PCS         | 2D 


### Functions:

1. **Transforming** DEM from current GCS to another GCS.

2. **Projecting** DEM from current GCS to the corresponding PCS.

3. **Visuzlising** DEM in PCS as 2D image.

4. **Reading** elevation of specific locations from DEM in GCS.
